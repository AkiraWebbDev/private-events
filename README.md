# Private Events
The Private Events web-app was made as part of the [Ruby on Rails curriculum from The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails).
As a way to familiarise myself with Active Record Associations, [this project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events) challenged me to implement a website with features much like Eventbrite.

## Features (WIP)
- Allows users to create and publish events.
- Users can follow and attend events.
- Events can be made private, so only invited users can see and attend them.
